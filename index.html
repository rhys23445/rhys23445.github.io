                    <p>Hey, I'm Alex. I am the co-owner of Iron Dancers. I began playing SSO on the 25th of December 2022. Even though I began playing sso recently I have loved and followed the game for many years prior. I first joined the club in March of 2023. In June 2023 I became a co-owner of the club and now help with all aspects of the club. I love everyone in the club and I think it is very welcoming! I love doing the events and we all have lots of fun. The members both past and current are definitely some of the best people I've met in sso.</p>
